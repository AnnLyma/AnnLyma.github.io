I created this blog as a part of my AI path thanks to suggestion from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai): the sixth (or so) ML-related course that I'm taking :sweat_smile: :D.

I made (and continue making) all kinds of mistakes on this long way, and I hope to share my experience to encourage (or discourage :D :smiley:) fellow humanities graduates to jump in AI (or in IT in general).
